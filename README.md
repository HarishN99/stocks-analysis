# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis was intended to refactor and compare the refactored code with the code originally designed to help Steve analyze a handful of green energy stocks to see which are best for his parents to invest into. The original code was refactored to run through the data faster in hopes of being able to analyze thousands of stocks in the future. 

## Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

# Stocks-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis was intended to refactor and compare the refactored code with the code originally designed to help Steve analyze a handful of green energy stocks to see which are best for his parents to invest into. The original code was refactored to run through the data faster in hopes of being able to analyze thousands of stocks in the future. 

## Results

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

(insert image of 2017 stock performance)
(insert image of 2018 stock performance)
(Compare)

(insert images of new code run times)
(insert images of old code run times)
Compare
- Reference code which makes it faster
- touch on improvements to readability maybe
- Emphasize the refactored code is faster.

~Either do two separate descriptions of each or do one larger description comaparing the two. Also maybe include run tiems for each year.

## Summary

Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages
- use less memory
- easier to understand, more readable
- code runs faster
- easier to maintain in the long run

Disadvantages
- Need to make sure it still works (may lose functionality)
- may introduce new bugs

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
